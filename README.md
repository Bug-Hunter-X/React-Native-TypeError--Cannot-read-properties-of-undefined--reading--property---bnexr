# React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where you attempt to access a property of a state variable before it has been properly initialized.  This often happens with asynchronous operations, where the data might not be available immediately when the component renders.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, resulting in a `TypeError`. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version that addresses the issue, ensuring that state variables are properly handled before accessing their properties.

## How to reproduce the error:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the application on your emulator or device.
4. Observe the error message in the console (or the application's behavior if the error handling is not properly implemented).

## Solution:

The solution involves adding checks to ensure the state variable is defined and has the expected properties before attempting to access them. This often involves using optional chaining (`?.`) or the logical AND operator (`&&`) to safely access properties only if the variable is defined and has the necessary properties.
