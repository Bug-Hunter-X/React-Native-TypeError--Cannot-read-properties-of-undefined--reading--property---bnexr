This error occurs when you try to access a property of a state variable before it has been properly initialized. This is common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when the state is updated in a way that is not immediately reflected in the component's render method. For example, if you have a state variable `userData` that is populated after a network request, accessing `userData.name` before the request completes will cause a TypeError.
